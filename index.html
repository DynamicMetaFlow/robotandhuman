<h2 id="about">About this comic</h2>

<p>When I heard about <a href="https://neocities.org/">NeoCities</a> and its
low-file-size, client-side-only restrictions, I immediately thought of
resurrecting this project, which I had intended to enter into the old <a
href="http://the5k.org/">5k competition</a> (but didn't get a chance to before
it stopped running).</p>

<p>The original version had just three comics and was entirely in static HTML, with a sprinkling of CSS.
But this incarnation is <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a>-powered.  What that means is that I drew
some graphics and wrote some JavaScript and now all I have to do to make a new
strip is write it in JSON.  If you think that sounds easier than just drawing a
picture and uploading it, you might be a programmer.</p>

<p>If you want to see how any of this works, or perhaps use it yourself, check out
<a href="https://github.com/Triskaideka/robotandhuman">the GitHub repository</a>.

<a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT License</a> (note that jQuery and its plugins are separate projects).

<p>P.S.: If the comics don't display right (or at all), you might be using an outdated web browser.  Please keep current!
Web developers everywhere will thank you for it.</p>

<p>Apparently writing webcomic tools is something I do.  Check out the <a
href="https://github.com/Triskaideka/comicpub">Poor Man's Comic Publisher</a> on
GitHub.  If you have a webserver where you can run PHP scripts, PMCP is a
relatively low-effort way to make comics you've drawn available to a web
audience.  You can also read more comics about our friends Robot &amp; Human
at my <a href="http://triskaideka.net/comicpub/">PMCP demo page</a>.</p>

<p>If you prefer the kind of comics tool where you don't have to draw anything,
but also don't want to get your own web site and do want a wider variety of clip
art, then <a href="http://www.stripcreator.com/">Stripcreator</a> is for you.
(I didn't make this one.)</p>
