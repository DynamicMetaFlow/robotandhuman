<h2 id="about">About this comic</h2>

<p>Robot &amp; Human is a <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a>-powered webcomic.  What that means is that I drew
some graphics and wrote some JavaScript and now all I have to do to make a new
strip is write it in JSON.  If you think that sounds easier than just drawing a
picture and uploading it, you might be a programmer.</p>

<p>The original code for this project may be re-used and re-distributed under the terms of the 
<a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT License</a> (jQuery <a href="https://jquery.org/license/">also uses the

<p>If you want to set up this tool on your own site, you'll need to copy (and then probably modify) these files:</p>

<ul>
  <li>index.html (i.e. this page)&mdash;you'll probably want to modify it heavily, but you should keep the JS/CSS calls in the head, and note that comics.js needs the element with an ID of "place" so it knows where to insert things.</li>
  <li><a href="http://jquery.com/download/">jQuery 2.0.1</a>, or another version if you prefer; I'm not aware of any compatibility issues</li>
  <li><a href="comics.js">comics.js</a> (the "engine")</li>
  <li><a href="rhwc.css">rhwc.css</a>&mdash;again, you'll probably make a lot of changes to this, but the code that comics.js produces won't make any sense at all without a lot of styling</li>
  <li>maybe <a href="comics.json.txt">comics.json</a>, just to see the format, although this is the bulk of the comic's content, so you'll eventually want to delete what's there and write your own</li>
  <li>the image files <a href="human-fl.png">human-fl.png</a>, <a href="human-fr.png">human-fr.png</a>, <a href="robot-fl.png">robot-fl.png</a>, and <a href="robot-fr.png">robot-fr.png</a>, and/or you can make your own graphics</li>
</ul>

<p>P.S.: If the comics don't display right (or at all), you might be using an outdated web browser.  Please keep current!
Web developers everywhere will thank you for it.</p>

<p>Apparently writing webcomic tools is something I do.  Check out the <a
href="https://github.com/Triskaideka/comicpub">Poor Man's Comic Publisher</a> on
GitHub.  If you have a webserver where you can run PHP scripts, PMCP is a
relatively low-effort way to make comics you've drawn available to a web
audience.  You can also read more comics about our friends Robot &amp; Human 
at my <a href="http://triskaideka.net/comicpub/">PMCP demo page</a>.</p>

<p>If you prefer the kind of comics tool where you don't have to draw anything,
but also don't want to get your own web site and do want a wider variety of clip
art, then <a href="http://www.stripcreator.com/">Stripcreator</a> is for you.
(I didn't make this one.)</p>
